# GreenSpender ðŸ’µ

GreenSpender is an innovative solution designed to simplify and streamline expense tracking through the power of photos and cutting-edge AI technology. By simply snapping a photo of a receipt, users can swiftly and effortlessly record their expenses, eliminating the need for tedious manual data entry.

This project was ideated and developed as part of our participation in UNIHACK 2024, Australia's premier and largest university student hackathon. Teams at UNIHACK have 48 hours to design and build something awesome - be it a website, a mobile application, a video game, or even something hardware. Our team chose to tackle the challenge of making expense tracking effortless and efficient.
